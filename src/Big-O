For the printInOrder method, the run time complexity would be O(n) because it has one for loop.
The n value would be equal to the cart size since the for loop is created as such:
for(int i = 0; i < cartSize; i++).

For the emptyCartReverseOrder method, the run time complexity would also be O(n).
It has one loop that will run n number of times where n is equal to the items in the cart.
for(int i = cart.size()-1; i >= 0; i--)
